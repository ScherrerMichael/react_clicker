## how to run

Im using yarn instead of npm but you can upload package-lock.json if you want
Were also using webpack to build the file js from all the ts file in src

* install dependency's
  `yarn install` or `npm install`

* run webpack
  `yarn run webpack` or `npm run webpack`

* open the `index.html` file in a browser

## project layout
```
# the root html, the browser will start here
index.html

# the compiled js files from the typescript compiler
dist/main.js

# source files
src/
├── components     # our react components
│   └── Game.tsx   # the entry point for our game
└── index.tsx      # the root of the project, Game will be sourced here
```
